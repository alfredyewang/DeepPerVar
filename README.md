## DeepPerVar

We propose WEVar, a new weighted ensemble learning framework, to predict and prioritize functional relevant non-coding variations. The WEVar framework integrates nine algorithms on functional annotation of non-coding variants by training a constrained logistic regression with the transformed score.
